# Verifiable FHE

I used Zama's tfhe-rs library to write code backed by fully homorphic encryption and ran it in Risc0's ZKVM to prove simple cryptographic operations. Please note, the code is not production-ready; you will need to reconfigure it for your specific research or points of observation. The idea originated at the ZkHack Krakow hackathon, where I attempted to integrate the specifications of the tfhe-rs library with the Risc0 stack and verify the receipt externally. The project received strong support from Risc0 engineers who assisted with its execution.

Check the documentation (it includes all tutorials on how to set up the environment and download Risc0 crates):
